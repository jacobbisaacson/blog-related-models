## To do list

* article show page -- should contain all the article info, including the author's name
* author show page shoudl include a list of their articles, which should be links that you can click on to go to that article's show page
* you should be able to delete the article (maybe from show page?)
* user should be able to edit and update articles, including changing the author (after update, redirect back to show page?)
* deleting an author should delete all the articles by that author -- do it manually in the author destroy ("destroy")
